# Power-BI--Blinkit Dashboard



## Problem Statement:
 
Blinkit, a fast-growing quick commerce platform, aims to optimize its sales performance, enhance customer satisfaction, and streamline inventory distribution. 
However, the absence of a data-driven approach makes it challenging to identify key trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.  
To address this, a **Power BI dashboard** has been developed to analyze Blinkit's sales data, leveraging various KPIs and visualizations. This dashboard provides insights into sales trends,
customer preferences, and outlet performance across different metrics like fat content, item type, outlet size, and location. By utilizing data-driven decision-making, 
Blinkit can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and drive revenue growth.

## Steps followed:

Step 1: **Requirement Analysis** – Defined the business objectives, KPIs, and visualization needs to analyze Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. This step ensured clarity on the data requirements and expected insights.  

Step 2: **Data Walkthrough** – Explored the dataset to understand its structure, attributes, and quality, identifying any missing or inconsistent values. This helped in planning necessary data transformations for accurate analysis.  

Step 3: **Data Connection** – Connected Power BI to the Blinkit dataset using appropriate data sources, ensuring seamless data access. This step enabled real-time updates and efficient data retrieval.  

Step 4: **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicate entries, handled missing values, and standardized data formats to ensure accuracy. Cleaning the data was essential for reliable analysis and meaningful insights.  

Step 5: **Data Modelling** – Established relationships between different tables and optimized data structure for efficient querying. This step ensured a well-structured data model to support complex analysis.  

Step 6: **Data Processing** – Transformed and aggregated raw data into meaningful formats, preparing it for visualization. This included calculations, grouping, and restructuring to facilitate better insights.  

Step 7: **DAX Calculation** – Created measures and calculated columns using DAX to derive essential KPIs such as total sales, average rating, and sales by category. These calculations helped in making the dashboard dynamic and interactive.  

Step 8: **Dashboard Lay Outing** – Designed the overall layout of the Power BI dashboard, ensuring a clear and user-friendly interface. The layout was structured to present insights in an intuitive and engaging manner.  

Step 9: **Charts Development & Formatting** – Created visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent key metrics effectively. Formatting and styling were applied for better readability and impact.  

Step 10: **Dashboard Development** – Integrated all visual elements, KPIs, and filters into a fully functional Power BI dashboard. The dashboard was tested to ensure interactivity and accurate data representation.  

Step 11: **Insight Generation** – Analyzed trends, patterns, and key takeaways from the dashboard to provide actionable business insights. These insights helped in optimizing sales strategies, inventory management, and customer experience.
